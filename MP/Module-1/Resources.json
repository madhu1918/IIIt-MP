			"text": "<b>Why Resources</b><br>You should always keep things like images and layouts separate in the res folder. Keeping resource files and values independent helps you easily maintain them if you need to update, say, all your button images to match a new style. The Android Framework also easily allows for alternative resources that support specific device configurations such as different languages or screen sizes. Providing a customized experience for users from different locations or on different devices becomes increasingly important as more of the world comes online and more devices come on the market. We will see how to provide alternate resources for different configurations and locals later in this course."
