In this exercise, you'll be working with only two files: app/build.gradle (not to be confused with the build.gradle not in the app folder) and activity_main.xml.<br><br>activity_main.xml is the layout file that determines what is shown in the MainActivity.java file. It has a ConstraintLayout surrounding a TextView. In this exercise, you'll change the ConstraintLayout to a FrameLayout. A FrameLayout is a layout that generally contains one view or overlapping views. You'll also update a bunch of attributes for the TextView. <br><br>In the app/build.gradle you simply need to delete the ConstraintLayout dependency."
