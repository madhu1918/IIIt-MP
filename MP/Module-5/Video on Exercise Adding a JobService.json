You DO NOT want to useimport android.app.job.JobService. The latter is used for JobScheduler and remember, we're using FirebaseJobDispatcher because it is compatible with older versions of Android.<br><br>This is the first part of a two part exercise. In this exercise you will make a JobService. In the next exercise you will schedule it using <a href=\"https://github.com/firebase/firebase-jobdispatcher-android\">FirebaseJobDispatcher.</a>"
